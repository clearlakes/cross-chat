# Cross-chat bot for Discord
This is just an example of a cross-chat bot for anyone who wants to know how it works / host one themselves.

Credit goes to the many Stack Overflow questions that have helped in figuring out what is needed to make it work!

## Commands
The commands included are as follows:
- `.setchannel` = sets the cross-chatting channel to the one that the command is sent in
- `.mod (user)` and `.unmod (user)` = mods and unmods a user (moderators have access to the blacklist commands, only the bot owner can send `.mod` and `.unmod`)
- `.blacklist (user)` and `.unblacklist (user)` = blacklists and unblacklists a user (bans them from cross-chatting)
